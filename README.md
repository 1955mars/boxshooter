# Introduction

Box-Shooter is a First-Person-Shooter single-player 3D game in which the player has to increase the time of survival by shooting particular targets while scoring points at the same time to win the levels.

I have developed a 2-level Box-Shooter game as a part of Coursera's Game design and development specialization. In this article, I'm going to present the design and development process I have taken while building this game.

Watch the gameplay video of Box-Shooter below.

For level 2, I have increased the game-play area and used a  different skybox. The player will be facing more tougher targets which will be explained in the following sections.
